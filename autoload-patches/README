== Content of this directory ==

This directory contains patch files that reflect the changes of existing classes
from other extensions that are overloaded with the Mediawiki autoload feature.
The patches in this directory are for documentation purposes only. They will not
be applied during the install process of this extension. When the original
extension gets updated the original class may change. These changes are not
available in the overloaded class. Therefore the class in this extension that
overloads the original class should be checked whether it must be changed as
well to reflect all changes in the original class.

== Build process ==

These patches are not applied in the build process nor are they packed into the
zip file. They exist on the SVN only. If the extension of the overloaded class
changes and the class itself changes, it must be checked by the developer if the
changes must be applied to the overloading class. Also a new patch must be
created if changes are applied to the overloading class.
Also when overloading a class, the developer of this extension must check the
deploy descriptor that all prerequisites are defined correctly. This is mainly
the version of the extensions which class gets overloaded.
