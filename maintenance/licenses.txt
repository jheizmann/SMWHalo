Easy-to-use cross-browser tooltips.
Just include the script at the beginning of the <body> section, and invoke
Tip('Tooltip text') from within the desired HTML onmouseover eventhandlers.
No container DIV, no onmouseouts required.
By default, width of tooltips is automatically adapted to content.
Is even capable of dynamically converting arbitrary HTML elements to tooltips
by calling TagToTip('ID_of_HTML_element_to_be_converted') instead of Tip(),
which means you can put important, search-engine-relevant stuff into tooltips.
Appearance of tooltips can be individually configured
via commands passed to Tip() or TagToTip().
