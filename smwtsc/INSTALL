Configure a triplestore
=======================

Add to LocalSettings.php:

    $smwgHaloWebserviceEndpoint="localhost:8080";  // localhost:8080 is default of TSC
    
Optional:

    $smwgHaloTripleStoreGraph = 'graph-uri';

graph-uri is an arbitrary URI which works as an identifier for the wiki in the
TSC. Every URI is possible as long as it does not contain a hash character (#).
If it is not set 'http://mywiki' is the default.

If the webserver requires (Basic) HTTP authorization, add:

    $smwgHaloWebserviceUser = "username";
    $smwgHaloWebservicePassword = "password";

You may now initialize the TSC on the page Special:TSA. Refer to the triplestore
documentation for a better way of initialization.

Non-existing pages
==================
$smwgHaloNEPEnabled=true;

activates a feature which displays facts about an instance only available in the 
triplestore. It is enabled whenever a red-link is selected.


Quad mode
=========
$smwgHaloQuadMode=true;
Activate this if the TS works in quad mode.
