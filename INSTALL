== Disclaimer ==

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without
making any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you
can try out the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall
mechanism is provided). Every serious wiki should be subject to regular
database backups! If you have any specific questions, please contact
the authors.

== Requirements (unbundled) ==

 * PHP 5.2 or PHP 5.3
 * MediaWiki 1.16.x (see installation guide)
 * ScriptManager 1.0 (see installation guide)
 * Semantic MediaWiki 1.5.2 (Please make reference to the installation instructions)
 * ARC Library 1.0 (see installation guide)
 * Web browser (for clients, recommended Firefox 3.x or Internet Explorer 8. There might be glitches with other browsers)

== Requirements (bundled) ==

 * PHP 5.2.x or PHP 5.3.x
 * MediaWiki 1.16.x (see installation guide)
 * Semantic MediaWiki 1.5.2 (Please make reference to the installation instructions)
 * Web browser (for clients, recommended Firefox 3.x or Internet Explorer 8. There might be glitches with other browsers)

== Installation ==

We recommend to install the Halo Extension using the SMW+ Administration tool
which is part of the Deployment Framework Extension (Download: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/halo-extension/files/smwhalo-deploy-1.2.zip/download). 
It empowers the convenient administration and automatic setup of extensions for
MediaWiki and Semantic MediaWiki. If you upgrade an existing installation of
SMW+, also read the remarks in the section "Notes on Upgrading" below.

 
(1) Download and install the ScriptManager extension into your Mediawiki
    installation.  In case you have the bundled version you can omit this step.
    
(2) Download and install the ARCLibrary extension into your Mediawiki
    installation. In case you have the bundled version you can omit this step.

(3) Extract the ZIP archive to the directory
    <mw-dir>\htdocs\mediawiki\extensions\

	Note: 	Replace <mw-dir> with the path to root directory of MediaWiki.

(4) Edit the configuration file <mw-dir>\htdocs\mediawiki\LocalSettings.php

(5)	Add the following code in a place before any other extension is loaded. This
    initializes the ScriptManager and the ARCLibrary extension first, so that
    all following extensions make use of these two that are already available.

	 require_once("extensions/ScriptManager/SM_Initialize.php");
	 require_once("extensions/ARCLibrary/ARCLibrary.php");
     enableARCLibrary();

(6) Change $wgDefaultSkin='ontoskin3';

(7) Add following lines to initialize the Halo Extension:

	include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php');
	enableSMWHalo(/*param-start-enableSMWHalo*/'SMWHaloStore2', NULL, NULL/*param-end-enableSMWHalo*/);
	$wgUseAjax=true;

(8) Open a command-line interface

(9) Navigate to the directory
     <mw-dir>\extensions\SemanticMediaWiki\maintenance\

(10) Run the script SMW_setup.php to initialize the database tables

(11) Download the Deployment Framework to install the patches:
	 https://sourceforge.net/projects/halo-extension/files/smwhalo-deploy-1.2.zip/download

(12) Extract the zip-file into the MediaWiki roots folder

(13) Open a command-line interface to install the patches
     The file patch.txt is an Eclipse patch file which can be installed using the
     tool patch.php from the deploy framework which itself uses GNU patch. The
     file is located in the directory 'extensions\SMWHalo'.

(14) Enter the following command:
     php patch.php -p patch.txt -d <mw-dir> --onlypatch
     replace <mw-dir> with the absolute path of your Mediawiki installation.

(15) To apply the patch for Mediawiki please also run:
     php patch.php -p patch_for_MW1.16.0.txt -d <mw-dir> --onlypatch
     replace <mw-dir> with the absolute path of your Mediawiki installation.
     replace patch_for_MW1.16.0.txt with the correct version for your Mediawiki
     installation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: 	Replace < mw-dir > with the path to root directory of MediaWiki.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: 	If you are using Linux, make the smwadmin.sh executable (chmod +x smwadmin.sh)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



=== Testing your Installation ===

If you are uncertain that everything went well, you can do some testing steps to
check if SMW is set up properly.

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see SMW+ Extension (version nn)
listed as a Parser Hook.

Create a regular wiki page named "TestSMW", and in it enter the wiki text
  Property test:  [[testproperty::Dummypage]]
  [[Category:Test]]

Then, create the page "Category:Test" and insert some dummy text.

Go to Special:OntologyBrowser. As soon as the interface is loaded, you should see
"Test" in the category tree. Click on it and you should see "TestSMW" in the
instance view. Click on it, and you should see "testproperty   Dummypage" in the
properties view.

If you don't get these results, check the steps in the installation section, consult
the FAQ section, then contact the user support list (see the Contact section).

=== Options ===

1.  Deploy version uses packed version of scripts
    $smwgDeployVersion=false;

2.  Uses EDITDISTANCE function for near matching.
    Take a look in libs/mysqlUDFs/INSTALL.TXT for more information.
    $smwgUseEditDistance = true;

3.  Show derived facts in a tab next to explicit facts. Makes only sense when a
    TSC is connected. Note that the factbox must be switch on.
    Refer to SemanticMediaWiki/includes/Settings.php
    $smwgShowDerivedFacts=true;

4.  $smwgPropertyPageFromTSC: Reads annotations on property pages from the TSC,
    not from the MySQL store.
    
5.  Enable the Query Results Cache. Please note that the full feature richness
    of the Query Results Cache is only available, if the Query Updator, which is
    deployed together with the Triple Store Connector is installed. The behaviour
    of the Query Results Cache can be configured
    in ./includes/QueryResultsCache/QRC_Settings.php
 	enableQueryResultsCache();

6.  One may use the OntologyBrowser to modify the ontology. Specify the appropriate 
	rights (in this example for the WikiSysop) for modifying the ontology, otherwise 
	you can only browse through.

	$wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['ontologyediting'] = true;

7.  If you protect your wiki with a htaccess file and use the Auth Digest method
    then you need to set the http password in the variable $smwgHttpAuthPassword.
    The username will be taken from the http request, and is not set here.

    $smwgHttpAuthPassword='your password';

=== Configuring a triplestore ===
Change the line with 'enableSMWHalo' to:

 enableSMWHalo('SMWHaloStore2', 'SMWTripleStore', 'graph-uri');

graph-uri is an arbitrary URI which works as an identifier for the wiki in the
TSC. Every URI is possible as long as it does not contain a hash character (#).

Then add:
    $smwgMessageBroker="localhost";
    $smwgWebserviceEndpoint="localhost:8080";

If the webserver requires HTTP authorization, add:
    $smwgWebserviceUser = "username";
    $smwgWebservicePassword = "password";

You may now initialize the TSC on the page Special:TSA. Refer to the triplestore
documentation for a better way of initialization.

=== Customizing Semantic MediaWiki+ ===

Semantic MediaWiki can be customized by a number of settings. To do so, you
can set respective parameters somewhere below the line
"include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php'); "
in your LocalSetting.php. For example, one can write

 include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php');
 $smwgAllowNewHelpQuestions = true;

to allow users to add new help questions to the system. There are various settings
which are documented here:

http://smwforum.ontoprise.com/smwforum/index.php/Help:Customizing_SMW%2B

== Notes on Upgrading ==

=== Upgrading from earlier versions ===

In order to create new tables and update old ones, open a command-line interface
and navigate to the directory $IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/maintenance/. Then
run the script SMW_setup.php to update the database tables.

In addition, run the script SMW_refreshData.php, which is located in the same directory.

Since SMWHalo 1.5.x the ScripManager extension is required. This is a small
extension that handles the include of some general Javascript libraries such as
Prototype or jQuery. These libraries are needed within the SMWHalo extension and
other extensions of the Halo project. If these libraries are not included in the
correct order on the webpage, the javascripts that are used on this page might
not work correctly or do not work at all. The ScriptManager eliminates the fact
that each extension must include it's own version of these libraries and that
each of these libraries is included only once.
