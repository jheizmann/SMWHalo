== Disclaimer ==

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without
making any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you
can try out the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall
mechanism is provided). Every serious wiki should be subject to regular 
database backups! If you have any specific questions, please contact 
the authors.

== Requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.15.x
* Semantic MediaWiki 1.4.3
* PHP 5.x or greater installed and working (but not PHP 5.3.x)
* MySQL >= 4.0.14 (version required by MediaWiki)

== Installation ==

If you upgrade an existing installation of SMW+, also read the
remarks in the section "Notes on Upgrading" below.

(1) Extract the archive smwhalo-1.4.6.zip to obtain the directory "extensions" 
    which contains all relevant files. Copy this directory to the root directory of your MediaWiki
    installation or extract/download it to this location.

(2) Edit $IP/LocalSettings.php and add:

      $wgUseAjax = true;
      include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
      enableSemantics('example.org');
      include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php');
      enableSMWHalo('SMWHaloStore2');
      
      please change:
       
      $wgDefaultSkin='ontoskin3';
      
(3) Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory $IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/maintenance/.
    Run the script SMW_setup.php to initialize the database tables.
    
(4) Install the patch file. It's an Eclipse patch file which can be installed 
    using the tool patch.php from the deploy framework (smwhalo-deploy-1.0) which
    itself uses GNU patch. The patch.php is also included in this extension. Go into
    the root directory of the extension. Run the following command:
    
       php patch.php -p <patch-file> -d <mw-dir> --onlypatch
    


=== Testing your Installation ===

If you are uncertain that everything went well, you can do some testing steps to
check if SMW is set up properly.

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see SMW+ Extension (version nn)
listed as a Parser Hook.

Create a regular wiki page named "TestSMW", and in it enter the wiki text
  Property test:  [[testproperty::Dummypage]]
  [[Category:Test]]
 
Then, create the page "Category:Test" and insert some dummy text.
 
Go to Special:OntologyBrowser. As soon as the interface is loaded, you should see
"Test" in the category tree. Click on it and you should see "TestSMW" in the
instance view. Click on it, and you should see "testproperty   Dummypage" in the
properties view.

If you don't get these results, check the steps in the installation section, consult
the FAQ section, then contact the user support list (see the Contact section).

=== Options ===

1.  Deploy version uses packed version of scripts
    $smwgDeployVersion=false;

2.  Default collation for SMWHalo database tables
    $smwgDefaultCollation="latin1_bin";

3.  Uses EDITDISTANCE function for near matching. 
    Take a look in libs/mysqlUDFs/INSTALL.TXT for more information.
    $smwgUseEditDistance = true;
    
4.  Show derived facts in a tab next to explicit facts. Makes only sense when a TSC is connected.
    Note that the factbox must be switch on. Refer to SemanticMediaWiki/includes/Settings.php 
    $smwgShowDerivedFacts=true;

5.  Enables F-logic rules (the default wiki rule language). Makes only sense when a TSC is connected.
    In case that SemanticRules extension is installed, it activates the rule editor too.    
     $smwgEnableFlogicRules=true;

6.  OntologyBrower uses Triplestore to display instances/annotations.
    Makes only sense when a TSC is connected.
    $smwgOBInstanceDataFromTriplestore=true;     
     
7.  Special mode, if TSC runs as a quad store: in case that driver=ontobroker-quad     
    $smwgTripleStoreQuadMode=true;

8.  Allows to enter new help questions for context-sensitive help.
    $smwgAllowNewHelpQuestions = true;   
    
=== Configuring a triplestore ===
Change the line with 'enableSMWHalo' to:

 enableSMWHalo('SMWHaloStore2', 'SMWTripleStore', 'graph-uri');
 
graph-uri is an arbitrary URI which works as an identifier for the wiki in the TSC. Every URI
is possible as long as it does not contain a hash character (#).

Then add:
    $smwgMessageBroker="localhost";
    $smwgWebserviceEndpoint="localhost:8080";
    
If the webserver requires HTTP authorization, add:
    $smwgWebserviceUser = "username";
    $smwgWebservicePassword = "password";
    
You may now initialize the TSC on the page Special:TSA. Refer to the triplestore documentation for a better
way of initialization.
     
=== Customizing Semantic MediaWiki+ ===

Semantic MediaWiki can be customized by a number of settings. To do so, you
can set respective parameters somewhere below the line
"include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php'); "
in your LocalSetting.php. For example, one can write

 include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php');
 $smwgAllowNewHelpQuestions = true;

to allow users to add new help questions to the system. There are various settings
which are documented here:

== Notes on Upgrading ==

=== Upgrading from earlier versions ===

In order to create new tables and update old ones, open a command-line interface and navigate to 
the directory $IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/maintenance/. Then run the script SMW_setup.php 
to update the database tables.

In addition, run the script SMW_refreshData.php, which is located in the same directory.
