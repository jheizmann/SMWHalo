== Disclaimer ==

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without
making any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you
can try out the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall
mechanism is provided). Every serious wiki should be subject to regular 
database backups! If you have any specific questions, please contact 
the authors.

== Requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.13 
* Semantic MediaWiki 1.4.x
* PHP 5.x or greater installed and working
* MySQL >= 4.0.14 (version required by MediaWiki)


== Installation ==

If you upgrade an existing installation of SMW+, also read the
remarks in the section "Notes on Upgrading" below!

(1) Extract the archive smwplus-1.4.zip to obtain the directory "extensions" 
    which contains all relevant files. Copy this directory to "[wikipath]"
    (or extract/download it to this place).
    We abbreviate "[wikipath]/extensions/SMWHalo" as "[SMW+_path]" below.

(2) Edit [wikipath]\LocalSettings.php and add:

      $wgUseAjax = true;
      include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php'); 
      enableSMWHalo();
      $phpInterpreter = "<path to PHP executable>";
      
      please change:
       
      $wgDefaultSkin='ontoskin';
      
(3) In your wiki, log in as a user with admin status and go to the page
    "Special:SMWAdmin" to do the final setup steps.
    Press "Initialise or upgrade tables" to finalize installation
    
(4) OPTIONAL: If you want to use the 'ExportOntologyBot' you have to create a directory
    'wikiexport' in extensions/SMWHalo. The directory must have write access for
    the user which runs Apache (or simply for all if possible).
    
(5) OPTIONAL: If you want to be able to rename categories, you have to remove (or uncomment) the 
    following code in [wikipath]\includes\Namespaces.php in function 'isMovable'
    
        || $index == NS_CATEGORY
      
(6) OPTIONAL: If you are also installing the extension package for SMW+, please refer to
    the install file delivered with the extension package zip file.

=== Installing Help ===

To install the online help, you must run the PHP script SMW_setup.php, which is located in the 
$IP/extensions/SMWHalo/maintenance/ directory. Simply execute the script with the --helppages option.

	php SMW_setup.php --helppages

This will install all help pages into the Help namespace.

 
=== Testing your Installation ===

If you are uncertain that everything went well, you can do some testing steps to
check if SMW is set up properly.

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see SMW+ Extension (version nn)
listed as a Parser Hook.

Create a regular wiki page named "TestSMW", and in it enter the wiki text
  Property test:  [[testproperty::Dummypage]]
  [[Category:Test]]
 
Then, create the page "Category:Test" and insert some dummy text.
 
Go to Special:OntologyBrowser. As soon as the interface is loaded, you should see
"Test" in the category tree. Click on it and you should see "TestSMW" in the
instance view. Click on it, and you should see "testproperty   Dummypage" in the
properties view.

If you don't get these results, check the steps in the installation section, consult
the FAQ section, then contact the user support list (see the Contact section).

=== Customising Semantic MediaWiki+ ===

Semantic MediaWiki can be customised by a number of settings. To do so, you
can set respective parameters somewhere below the line
"include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php'); "
in your LocalSetting.php. For example, one can write

 include_once('extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_Initialize.php');
 $smwgAllowNewHelpQuestions = true;

to allow users to add new help questions to the system. There are various settings
which are documented here:

== Notes on Upgrading ==

=== Upgrading from SMW+ 1.0, SMW+ 1.1, SMW+ 1.2 and SMW+ 1.3 ===

In order to create new tables and update old ones, you should go to 
Special:SMWAdmin and execute "Update/Initialize tables" once.

Then run extensions/SemanticMediawiki/maintenance/SMW_refreshData.php
