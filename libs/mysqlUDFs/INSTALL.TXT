TODOs:

1.) Copy the correct version of the library to your mysql/bin folder (or to some folder where your system searches for DLLs/shared object libs).

2.) Connect to your mysql database using the GUI-tool (e.g. the query browser) or the command line interface 
    and execute the following command: (replace the DLL's/shared object lib's name if necessary)

    CREATE FUNCTION editdistance RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'halowiki.dll';

3.) Done.
