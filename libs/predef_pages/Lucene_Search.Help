SMW+ incorporates Apache Lucene, a high-performance text search engine library written entirely in Java. Strictly speaking, it makes use of a customized version which is based on Lucene's search API (for more information, see [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Lucene-search Lucene-search]). This version extends Lucene's API to improve the wiki's full-text search capabilities by providing a ranking based on the number on backlinks, distributed searching and indexing, and parsing of wikitext, to name just a few.
