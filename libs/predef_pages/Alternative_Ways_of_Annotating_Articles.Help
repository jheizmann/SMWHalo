__NOTOC__
Annotations can also be made in the wiki text while editing. For that purpose, open the Edit page tab of an article. To add an annotation, type two opening square brackets <tt>'<nowiki>[[</nowiki>'</tt> and at least one letter. If you have enabled [[Help:Autocompletion|autocompletion]] in your [[Help:Preferences|Preferences]], you will be presented a list of possible completions.

If the desired property is not in the list, you may filter again by typing additional letters. Finally, choose a property. The system will print the property's full name and put a double colon (::) after it. Again, you can use autocompletion for the target instance. The annotation will automatically be closed by two closing square brackets <tt>'<nowiki>]]</nowiki>'</tt> when autocompletion is used for the target instance. If you don't use autocompletion or if the target instance is a link does not yet exist, close the annotation manually.
