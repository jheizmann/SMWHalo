__NOTOC__

With the Rich Media Extension you can let the system generate a list of related media (images, documents, pdf, audio and video) to every article.

Simply add the template <pre> {{RMList|{{FULLPAGENAME}}}} </pre> at the place you want the list to appear (usually the bottom of the page).

As a result you get a list like this example:
[[Image:Attached media.jpg|800px]]

[[Category:SMW+ Help Topic|Media List]]
[[SubsectionOf::Help:Media| ]]
