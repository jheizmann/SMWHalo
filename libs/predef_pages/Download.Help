Alternatively, you can download the SMW Halo extension package from the SourceForge repository. This open source version, however, requires some technical expertise as you have to install SMW+ manually. In addition, this package requires all necessary components such as the Apache HTTP server or the MySQL database to be preinstalled on your system.
