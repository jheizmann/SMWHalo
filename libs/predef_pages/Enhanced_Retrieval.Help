__NOTOC__

This release introduces the semantic relation retrieval feature. This feature extends the wiki search with a path search to find structures in the RDF graph. 

It supplements the title and full-text search. Generally speaking, the path search is about to find information which is not modeled as a single triple but as a series (or path) of triples. It's about finding pages identified by the search terms AND which are semantically linked. 

Visit [[Using_Path_Search|Using Path Search]] for an example of use.
